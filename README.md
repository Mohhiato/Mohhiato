- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mohhiato
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things! Linguistics, coding, animating (3D though) and overall asset creation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, C, C++, C#, Javascript, Python and Lua for programming languages, 3D animation as well as 3D asset creation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of right now!
- 📫 How to reach me - Don't.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, but I don't mind whichever pronouns you use.
- ⚡ Fun fact: N/A, I'm not fun 😛
